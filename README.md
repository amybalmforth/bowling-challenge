### BOWLING CHALLENGE

This is my attempt at the Makers Academy bowling challenge.

Here is what I managed to satisfy:

- Can bowl a ball
- Can bowl 20 balls and calculate a score
- Can calculate score for spares
- Can calculate score for strikes
- Have an interface with HTML, CSS and JQuery (unfinished)

I created a page for the webapp and an interface, but ran into problems getting the code to interact with the webapp. In order to get the scores recorded, I ended up a) creating a new score function as my original function would not calculate a running total b) creating ten methods each for knocking over a number of pins 1 to 10. As it stands, the scores don't display or add up correctly.
